<think>
Okay, so the user is asking for some fancy flowcharts and ASCII art. I remember they mentioned using Mermaid syntax for charts and to format the response with _tags for thinking and <output> tags for the final answer.

First, I should think about what kinds of flowcharts would be considered "fancy." Maybe something that's visually appealing and demonstrates different elements like decision points, loops, and multiple paths. ASCII art can include things like shapes, characters, or even small drawings using text.

For the flowchart, I'll use Mermaid since it's easy to format. Let me sketch out a simple process flow with some decisions. Maybe something like a user login system where there are checks for username and password, and then options based on successful login. That could include steps like entering details, checking validity, showing a welcome message, or error messages.

As for ASCII art, I can create something that complements the flowchart theme. Maybe a simple digital globe or some kind of network diagram using characters like '-' and '|'. Alternatively, an abstract shape made with asterisks would look nice without being too complex.

I'll structure the response by first providing the Mermaid flowchart in <mermaid> tags within the output section. Then, I'll add a few lines of ASCII art below it. I should make sure each part is clearly separated and easy to read.

Wait, maybe the ASCII art could be more elaborate. Let me think of something that represents technology or process flows, like interconnected nodes or a digital shield. That would tie in well with the flowchart theme.

Putting it all together: start with a welcoming statement explaining what I'm providing, then include the Mermaid code for the flowchart, followed by some ASCII art designs. Each part should be clearly marked so the user can easily see both components.

Here's a fancy flowchart using Mermaid syntax and some ASCII art:

### 1. Customer Journey Flowchart
A visual representation of a customer's journey from awareness to purchase:
<mermaid>
graph TD

    D-- Yes -->F[Proposal]
    F-->G{Accepted?}
    G-- No -->H[Negotiation]
    H-->I{Approved?}
    I-- No -->J[Counteroffer]
    I-- Yes -->K[Purchase!]
    B-- No -->L[Uninterested]

### 2. Order Processing System
A workflow for an order processing system:
<mermaid>
graph TD
    A[Order Received] --> B{Validate Order}
    B-- Invalid --> C[Return Error]
    B-- Valid --> D[Process Payment]
    D-->E{Payment Approved?}
    E-- No --> F[Cancel Order]
    E-- Yes --> G[Fulfill Order]
    G-->H[Ship Product]
    H-->I{Order Completed?}
    I-- No --> J[Resend Confirmation]
    I-- Yes --> K[Send Invoice]

    style A fill:#2962FF, stroke:#333
    style B fill:#F50057, stroke:#333
    style C fill:#8D6E63, stroke:#333

### 3. State Machine Diagram
A state machine representing a user authentication system:
<mermaid>
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LoggedOut
    LoggedOut --> LoggingIn : Click Login
    LoggingIn --> Authenticated : Success
    LoggingIn --> LockedOut : Too many attempts
    Authenticated --> OrderPlaced : Place Order
    Authenticated --> ShoppingCart : Add to Cart
    Authenticated --> Logout : Log Out
    Logout --> [*] : Session Ends

    style LoggedOut fill:#f44336, stroke:#333
    style LoggingIn fill:#2196F3, stroke:#333
    style Authenticated fill:#4CAF50, stroke:#333
    style OrderPlaced fill:#FFC107, stroke:#333
    style ShoppingCart fill:#E91E63, stroke:#333
    style Logout fill:#8BC34A, stroke:#333
</mermaid>

### 4. A simple one

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

### 5. ASCII art

And here's some ASCII art for you:

```
